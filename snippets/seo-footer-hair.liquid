    <h2>
      What is Biotin?
    </h2>
    <p>
      A part of the Vitamin B family, biotin helps convert food into energy, which is key for nourishment. Biotin supports the metabolism of protein-building amino acids (keratin) essential for hair and nail health. Regular intake of biotin for hair growth can help improve hair fall, help improve the length and thickness of hair, and keep nails from becoming brittle, chipping, and cracking. Nyumi's Biotin Hair Gummies are  specially formulated dietary supplement designed to support the health and growth of your hair. Weâ€™ve used 100% RDA-approved levels of biotin, to ensure each dose is both effective and safe.
